    description = "I started at WACKER in 2010 as a student for mechanical engineering. During the 3 years with WACKER's student program, I worked for both the Procurement and Logistics department as well as central engineering. After getting my Bachelor of Engineering, I started working in the Procurement's eBusiness Team on different tasks - standard application support and project work as well as unconventional and upcoming topics like building and rolling out new tools. In 2016, I was taking on new challenges as Procurement Manager for IT Hardware and Infrastructure - up until July 2018. Since August, I have returned to my roots at Procurement's Service division in our new \"Procurement Systems Innovation\" group. I am currently working on trending topics like the selection of the next generation of procurement tools, but also acting as a catalyst for new technologies - for example, one of my other projects is examining RPA's usecases to further automate processes."

    description = "As a digital native at heart, I embrace the challenges of digitalization and strife to make sure, WACKER is able to benefit from all the skills I bring to the table. Be it as skills picked up during my Bachelor's degree, in my daily work or during past time activities. In order to succeed with your project at hand, you often times need the right tool for the job. Or have you ever drilled a hole into a wall with a hammer? If so - stop reading and send me a quick email. We can build a business on that. Anyhow. I don't see myself as a specialist in either field. I rather see myself as a trick of all trades kind of person. So why me? Well, understanding both the process at hand, the background of multiple stakeholders and being able to get everyone on board and contribute to the necessary work has proven to be essential to successfully work towards digitalised processes."
